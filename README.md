# Kernel-V8-GPU-Architecture-Stress-Test
**Kernel-V8** is a high-performance GPU benchmarking engine built on the WebGL2 API. By rendering a complex 8th-order **Mandelbulb** fractal in real-time, it generates intense arithmetic workloads to evaluate the stability, thermal throttling, and peak compute throughput of modern graphics hardware.
